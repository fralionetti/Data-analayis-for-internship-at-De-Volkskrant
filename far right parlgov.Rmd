## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

##Step1: istalling the packages, reading the datasets, selecting the variables and merging them together
```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r file, echo=FALSE}
excel_file <- "C:/Users/lionet000/Downloads/parlgov.xlsx"
sheet_name <- "party"
parlgov <- read_excel(excel_file, sheet = sheet_name)
head(parlgov)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r merge, echo=FALSE}
parlgov_new <- parlgov %>%
  select(country_name, party_name, family_name, left_right, party_id)
print(parlgov_new)
```

```{r fileother, echo=FALSE}
excel_file2 <- "C:/Users/lionet000/Downloads/the populist.xlsx"
thepopulist <- read_excel(excel_file2)
print(thepopulist)
```


```{r fileother, echo=FALSE}
thepopulist_new <- thepopulist %>%
  select(populist, farright, eurosceptic, in_parliament, parlgov_id)

print(thepopulist_new)
```

```{r fileother, echo=FALSE}
merged_df <- merge(parlgov_new, thepopulist_new, by.x = "party_id", by.y = "parlgov_id")


print(merged_df)
```


```{r file2, echo=FALSE}
excel_file <- "C:/Users/lionet000/Downloads/parlgov.xlsx"
sheet_name2 <- "election"
right_parties_elections <- read_excel(excel_file, sheet = sheet_name2)
print(right_parties_elections)
```

```{r clean, echo=FALSE}
right_parties_elections <- right_parties_elections %>%
  select(party_id, election_type, election_date, vote_share, seats, seats_total, election_id)
print(right_parties_elections)
```

```{r merge, echo=FALSE}
merged_parties <- merge(merged_df, right_parties_elections, by = "party_id")

# Print the merged data frame
print(merged_parties)
```

```{r file3, echo=FALSE}
excel_file <- "C:/Users/lionet000/Downloads/parlgov.xlsx"
sheet_name3 <- "cabinet"
right_parties_cabinet <- read_excel(excel_file, sheet = sheet_name3)
print(right_parties_cabinet)
```

```{r clean, echo=FALSE}
right_parties_cabinet <- right_parties_cabinet %>%
  select(election_date, cabinet_id, party_id, prime_minister, cabinet_party, cabinet_name)
print(right_parties_cabinet)
```

```{r merge2, echo=FALSE}
parties_final <- merge(merged_parties, right_parties_cabinet, by =c("party_id", "election_date"))
print(parties_final)

write.csv(parties_final, "C:/Users/lionet000/Documents/far-right parties/parties_final.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```


##Step 2: Looking at the right-wing parties

First, i filter the parliamentary and the last election
```{r filter0, echo=FALSE}
right_parties_lastelections <- parties_final %>%
  filter(election_type == "parliament") 

selected_countries <- c(
  "Austria", "Belgium", "Bulgaria", "Croatia", "Cyprus", "Czech Republic",
  "Denmark", "Estonia", "Finland", "France", "Germany", "Greece", "Hungary",
  "Iceland", "Ireland", "Italy", "Latvia", "Lithuania",
  "Luxembourg", "Malta", "Netherlands", "Norway", "Poland", "Portugal",
  "Romania", "Slovakia", "Slovenia", "Spain", "Sweden", "Switzerland",
  "United Kingdom"
)

right_parties_lastelections <-right_parties_lastelections %>%
  group_by(country_name) %>%
  filter(election_date == max(election_date)) 

print(right_parties_lastelections)

write.csv(right_parties_lastelections, "C:/Users/lionet000/Documents/far-right parties/Right_parties_lastelections.csv", row.names = FALSE)



```

Now, I filter those parties that are identified a right-wing
```{r filter, echo=FALSE}
right_parties_final <- right_parties_lastelections %>%
  filter(farright == 1)

print(right_parties_final)
```


Now, I look at those right-wing parties that became part of the cabinet
```{r filter, echo=FALSE}
right_parties_cabinet <- right_parties_final %>%
  filter(cabinet_party == "1")

print(right_parties_cabinet)
```
